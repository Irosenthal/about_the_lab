# Byrnes Lab Code of Conduct

## Overview
Here in the Byrnes lab, we are dedicated to understanding the forces that shape life in the ocean and what they mean for the ever changing world. To do this, we acknowledge our role in shaping a positive, vibrant, and inclusive environment where we can spread our love of knowledge and of the sea. With this code of conduct, we seek to lay out policies and norms that will enable those goals.

## The Quick Version

In our lab, we are dedicated to creating a safe, welcoming, and healthy environment to nurture the best research and researchers to move science forward. This includes providing a harrassment-free space and welcome anyone regardless of race, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, religious beliefs, socioeconomic background, nationality, or other categories not explicitly enumerated here. We are here for the work and for our love of science and the sea. Discriminatory behavior, dehumanizing and objectifying language or imagery in any context, or lack of respect of each other - particularly with respect to the aforementioned categories, has no place in this lab. Nor in science, really. We want to make the culture of science better, starting at home.
